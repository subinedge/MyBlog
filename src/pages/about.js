      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I was born and brought up in Chennai, India. And the following is Cliche but true. Ever so true. My specialisation was in Mechanical Engineering and currently working as an SAP Consultant and my desire was to become a Web Developer. I've gone through so much hardwork to find my passion and also working in a job that I don't love, but that doesn't make me weak, infact it made me stronger to thrive for something that I love. Whether in personal matters or in job, the same things hold true.</p>
