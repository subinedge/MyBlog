I have been a professional web developer since march 2018 and used both MacOs and Windows in that time. My preferred OS to use is Windows, for no other reason than I prefer the keyboard layout.
With Windows/Linux I like to have my Ctrl key as the key to use for copy-paste operations and I can use my left pinky instead of my thumb. Anyway, let’s leave the weak reasoning behind as that’s not the purpose of this post!
If you don’t have a Windows machine then this post probably isn’t for you, if this is different from what you use, it doesn’t make it bad.

This is the refresh on my guide from the start of the year on setting up a web development environment on a Windows machine.
This guide will cover installing Ubuntu but you can use some of the other flavours of Linux available in the Windows store, the Debian setup will be very similar to the Ubuntu one.

## Topics Covered

1. Gatsby
2. Life Advice
